### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Here's a glimpse into my current projects:

### Chaos
Chaos is an ongoing initiative, delving into the realm of Chaos Theory. This project encompasses a collection of concepts, theorems, and practical implementations of dynamical systems. Anticipated completion is set for Summer 2024.

### Fanyi
Fanyi is designed to enhance NLP-based machine-generated novel translations using transfer learning techniques. Tailored for avid novel readers facing challenges with Asian novels due to limited quality translations, this project aims to provide reliable machine-generated translations. The anticipated completion date is Summer 2024.

### eParser
Meet eParser, a Python library dedicated to handling and parsing EPUB format files. Created with the objective of simplifying the extraction and parsing of eBooks, eParser was initially developed for a desktop eBook reader application. As of now, the project is complete, with occasional quality-of-life enhancements planned for the future.
